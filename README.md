MediTracker helps users track all their appointments, physicians, and insurance information in one application. Keeping track of your medical care can be overwhelming, but MediTracker will organize that for you.

## Lessons Learned:

This application allowed me to enhance my understanding of the MVC architecture (model,view,controller) in web development. The multi-dimensional dynamic of this website emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. With the MVC pattern it is much easier to manage and make changes to the frontend and backend side without them interfering with each other.
