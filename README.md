## Lessons Learned:

This application allowed me to enhance my understanding of the MVC architecture (model,view,controller) in web development. The multi-dimensional dynamic of this website emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. With the MVC pattern it is much easier to manage and make changes to the frontend and backend side without them interfering with each other.
